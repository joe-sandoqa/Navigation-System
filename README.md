This project utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm along with implementing multiple data structures such as a Linked List,
Minimum Heap, and a Stack all from scratch. With a properly formatted test case, this software will execute and return
the shortest possible path given a weighted directed graph, which may be implemented for a GPS/Navigation system.
